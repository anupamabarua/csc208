# Problem 4

## Find the closed formula for each of the given sequences $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ by relating them to a well-known sequence. Assume the first term given is $a_1.$



$\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(2, 4, 7, 11, 16, \dots\)$
    

$\[
    a_n = 
    \]



    \item \(0, 3, 8, 15, 24, \dots\)$
    

$\[
    a_n = 
    \]



    \item \(-1, 0, 3, 8, 15, \dots\)$
    

$\[
    a_n = 
    \]



    \item \(0, 4, 22, 118, 718, \dots\)$
    

$\[
    a_n = 
    \]$


\end{enumerate}
