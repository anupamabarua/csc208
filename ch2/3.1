# Pascal's Arithmetical Triangle

- Each number is a row and column
- rows are counted down starting at 0
- Colums are counted down starting at 0
- (n/k)
- Read as n choose k
## Example
- (6/3) = 20, because that is the value in row 6, column 3

## Interger Lattice
- The set of all points in the Cartesian plane
- Both x and y cordinates are intergers

## Lattice Paths
- One of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice
- Only moves horizontally and vertically
- For the path to be as short as possible, each move needs to be right or up
- Each path had a length of 5

## Bit Strings
- n-bit string: A bit string of length n. A string contaning n symbols where each bit is either 0 or 1
- Weight of a bit stribg is the number of 1s in it
- B n/k is the set of all n-bit strings of weight k

## Subsets
- A set A is any set all whose elements are also in A

## Bijection
- A dunction f: X -> Y such that each element of Y is the image of exactly one element from X
