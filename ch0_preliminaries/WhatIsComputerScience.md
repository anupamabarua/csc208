## Summary
Steve Wartik argues that computer science dosent fit into one spefic area of study. It is a blend of math, electerical enginnering, and a hint of psychology. John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan made abstractions that were more of a concept then a actual thing. Such as it dosent tell how long it takes for a program to execute. With all of this in mind, computer science later shifted towards more theoretical modles insted of things that actual exist. Computer science is better understood as a branch of philosiphy isnted of just a form of science.
 
## Why did we read this?
One of the reasons we read this is to see how far computer science has come since its start. It started as a "science" and has transformed into a philoisphy with abstract and theoretical values. This is important for us because we have shifted into the math class portion and it is imposrtant to understad how math and computer science relate to one another.

## John Hopcroft
- A american computer scientist
- Studies theoretical aspects of computing
- His textbooks on theory of computatuon and sata structures are known as standards in their fields.

## Robert Tarjan
- A american computer scientist and mathematician
- Discovered several graph theory algorithms
- Invented many high efficent algorithms
