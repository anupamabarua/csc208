## What is Discrete Mathematics?
- {0,1,2,3} is discrete because the elements are separate. Whereas $y = x^2$ is not discrete because the outputs are not separate. 

## What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?
1. Combinations
2. Sequences
3. Symbolic logic
4. Graph logic

## What is discrete structure?

- mathematical structures that are composed of distinct, separate elements

1. Set
- an unordered collection of elements
- {1, 2, 3, 4,}

2. Functions
- a rule that assigns each input exactly one output
- output is called the image of the input

3. Sequences
- finite and infinite sequences
- an ordered triple, the same way that (7,3) is an ordered pair
- can show function 3 ways:
	- tables
	- nth term
	- how to get from one term to the next

4. Relations
- how numbers are related
- could be =, >, <, or more
- Binary relations are between two numbers
- can be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive or more

5. Graphs
- dots and lines
- can count vertices, lines, edges
