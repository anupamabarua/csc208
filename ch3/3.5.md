# Problem 9

##  Conic, your favorite math themed fast food drive-in offers 17 flavors which can be added to your soda. You have enough money to buy a large soda with 7 added flavors. How many different soda concoctions can you order if:

## a. You refuse to use any of the flavors more than once?
- This question is just a combination without reption question
- The order of flavors added to the soda dosent matter

- $\binom{17}{7} = \frac{17!}{7!(17 - 7)!} = \frac{17!}{7!10!} = {19,448}$

## b. You refuse repeats but care about the order in which the flavors are added?
- permutation without reptition cause the order of flavors matter
- $P(17, 7) = \frac{17!}{(17 - 7)!} = \frac{17!}{10!} = {98,017,920}$


## c. You allow yourself multiple shots of the same flavor?
- You can represent this as a sticks and stones problem
- 7 stones for each flavor shot
- 16 sticks to seprate the flavor (16 sticks because you subract 1 from the amount of flavors)
- total number of postions for the 7 stones (flavors) 7+16=23
- $\binom{23}{7} = {245,157}$

## d. You allow yourself multiple shots, and care about the order in which the flavors are added?
- can repeat the flavors
- $17^7 = {410,338,673}$
