## What are outcomes
- Outcomes happen from diffrent events

## Sum and Product Principles
- Sum Principle: If an event A results in m outcomes and event B results in n disjoint outcomes, then the event "A or B" results in m+n outcomes.

- Disjoint is when A and B cant happen at the same time 

- Product principles : If event $A$ can occur in $m$ ways, and each possibility for $A$ allows for exactly $n$ ways for event $B$, then the event "$A$ and $B$" can occur in $m * n$ ways.
