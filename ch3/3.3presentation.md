## Question 4
In a recent survey, 115 students reported whether they liked their potatoes mashed, French-fried, or twice-baked. 53 liked them mashed, 51 liked French fries, and 70 liked twice baked potatoes. Additionally, 22 students liked both mashed and French-fried potatoes, 33 liked French fries and twice baked potatoes, 36 liked mashed and baked, and 16 liked all three styles. How many students hate potatoes? Explain why your answer is correct.

The values can be represented like:

$mashed = 53$  
$french = 51$  
$baked = 70$  
$mashed \cap french = 22$  
$baked \cap mashed = 36$  
$french \cap baked = 33$
$french \cap baked \cap mashed = 16$

In the textbook it shows us that we can visually solve this by creating a venndigram.
