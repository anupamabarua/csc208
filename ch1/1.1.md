# 1.1 Mathematical Statements

- premise: everything else is a squence of statements
- conclusion: the last thing in a sequence of statments
- argument: a sequence of statements
- theorem
- proposition
- proof: a statment is a sound argument whose conclusion is the statment
- statement: any declartive sentence which is wither true or false
- quantifier: makws a predicate true or false
- predicate: a statment that contains a free variable
- logical connective:[photo](/media/logicalconnective.png)
- binary connective: conncet teo statments 
- unary connective: only applies to a single statment
- truth value: 
- propositional variables: capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: .
 We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two values the variables can achieve: true or false
- conjunction: is ture when both p and q are true
- disjunction: is true when p OR q or both are true
- implication: when P is false or Q is true
- conditional: same as implication
- biconditional: true when P and Q are both true or both false
- negation: true when P is false
- truth conditions
